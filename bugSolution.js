```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
The solution shows the corrected paths for the routes.  Ensure that paths are accurate and consistent with the URLs used to navigate to the components. The addition of a `/contact` route demonstrates correct path specification.  The wildcard `*` path should always be the last route to catch any unmatched routes.
