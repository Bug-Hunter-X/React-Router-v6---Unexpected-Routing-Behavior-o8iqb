# React Router v6 - Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Router v6: incorrect path specifications within Route components leading to unexpected routing behavior.  The bug involves typos or missing path segments in the `path` prop of the `Route` component, causing pages to not render correctly or the wrong page to be displayed.

The solution involves carefully checking and correcting the paths within the `Route` components to precisely match the expected URL segments.
